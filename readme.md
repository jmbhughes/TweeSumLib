# TweeSumLib: Tweet Summarization Library for Python

This is a collection of summarization tools that have been somewhat optimized to run on tweets.  A python bound script is provided for easy running as well as some notes on each. Included here are the following algorithms:
* mead
* SumBasic
* TF-IDF
* Hybrid TF-IDF
* Opinosis
* Opinosis-T
* Random
* MostRecent
     
## Getting Started

Because there are many different libraries, each must be addressed differently. In [startups](docs/startups/) you will find start up instructions for every library. Some of them require more library initialization than others.

For a general overview of the kinds of summarization this system can perform please check the [final report](docs/report/report.pdf).

Each algorithm, even if it is written originally in some other language, has a python binding. The running script can be found in [src][src/] with the appropriate ALGORITHM.py file. 

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
