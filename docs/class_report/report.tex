\section{Introduction}
There are over 500 million tweets sent each day \todo{find a citation}. Many of these tweets pertain to social movements and become grouped under a topical heading, a hashtag. For example, \#LoveWins trended after the United States Supreme Court's legalization of same-sex marriage in 2015 and \#Ferguson trended after the social unrest following a police shooting in Ferguson, MO in 2014. Hashtags often come in pairs for and against a movement, e.g. \#DefundPP and \#StandWithPP in opposition and support of Planned Parenthood's funding respectively. Tweets with movement hashtags are often, but not always, accompanied with some statement explaining and/or supporting the poster's view of the movement. Previous work in argumentation mining proposed that these hashtags can be seen as a premise for an argument and that a classifier can determine which tweets support the premise with additional text and which are merely tweets with no suppor. Thus, Twitter can be used to probe public opinion and reasoning over popular issues. Due to the large volume of tweets, it is impossible to summarize the arguments without using an automated summarization technique.

Many such techniques have been proposed in literature. I explore many here.

\section{Previous Work}
Summarization of multiple documents, in this case tweets, can be categorized into two main groups: extractive and abstractive. The difficult first step of summarization is identifying which parts of a document are important. Thus, extractive summarization only identifies important portions of the text and groups them together without any further processing. This clearly does not lend itself for an easily readable summary. An extractive summary will likely have redundant words. OBFor example consider three imaginary tweets as a corpus: 1. ``Bill 2017 is too expensive but it'll get the job done.'' 2. ``Bill 2017 is too expensive but it's inherently racist.'' 3. ``Bill 2017 gets the job done, no more problems ever!''. An extractive summary selecting two out of three of these tweets will repeat words, e.g. Bill 2017, too expensive, get the job done. Further as \cite{Ganesan2010} illustrates, there are intrinsic biases in this kind of summary. Any extractive summary forced to pick between these tweets will miss important caveats presented by the others.

Abstractive summarization on the other hand can meld the three tweets into one summary, e.g. ``Bill 2017 will get the job done but it's expensive and racist'', to provide a more complete summary without redundant words. Abstractive summarization can range from anything as simple as exanding abbreviations to generating novel natural English summaries. More advanced abstractive summarization is much more difficult than extractive summarization, and thus the majority of work in summarization has been in extractive approaches up to this point.



\section{Algorithms}
\subsection{Random}
Without using any additional information from the tweets, the most basic approach to extractive summarization would be to pick random tweets from the corpus and call that a summary. That does not guarantee a representative sample. All the tweets in the summary may repeat each other. I have provided an implementation of it here.
