abstract = {Most multi-document summarizers utilize term frequency related features to determine sentence importance. No empirical studies, however, have been carried out to isolate the contribution made by frequency information from that of other features. Here, we examine the impact of frequency on various aspects of summarization and the role of frequency in the design of a summarization system. We describe SumBasic, a summarization system that exploits frequency exclusively to create summaries. SumBasic outperforms many of the summarization systems in DUC 2004, and performs very well in the 2005 MSE evaluation, confirming that frequency alone is a powerful feature in summary creation. We also demonstrate how a frequency-based summarizer can incorporate con- text adjustment in a natural way, and show that this adjustment contributes to the good performance of the summarizer and is sufficient means for duplication removal in multi-document summarization.},

abstract = {Twitter is one of the most popular social media platforms for online users to create and share information. Tweets are short, informal, and large-scale, which makes it difficult for online users to find reliable and useful information, arising the problem of Twitter summarization. On the one hand, tweets are short and highly unstructured, which makes traditional document summarization methods difficult to handle Twitter data. On the other hand, Twitter provides rich social-temporal context beyond texts, bringing about new opportunities. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit social-temporal context for Twitter summarization. In particular, we provide a methodology to model temporal con-text globally and locally, and propose a novel unsupervised summarization framework with social-temporal context for Twitter data. To assess the proposed framework, we manually label a real-world Twitter dataset. Experimental results from the dataset demonstrate the importance of social-temporal context in Twitter summarization.},

We summarize topics by sub-topics along time line to fully capture rapid topic evolution in Twitter. Specifically, we rank and select salient and diversified tweets as a summary of each sub-topic. We have observed that ranking tweets is significantly different from ranking sentences in traditional extractive document summarization. We model and formulate the tweet ranking in a unified mutual reinforcement graph, where the social influence of users and the content quality of tweets are taken into consideration simultaneously in a mutually reinforcing manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on 3.9 million tweets. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms previous approaches by 14 {\%} improvement on average ROUGE-1. Moreover, we show how the content quality of tweets and the social influence of users effectively improve the performance of measuring the salience of tweets.},

We empir- ically compare our approach with several state-of-the-art pattern summarization approaches along the axes of storage cost, query accuracy, query flexibility, and efficiency using real data from Twitter.
