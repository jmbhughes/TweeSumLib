F.~C.~T. Chua and S.~Asur, ``Automatic summarization of events from social
  media,'' in \emph{Proceedings of the Seventh International AAAI Conference on
  Weblogs and Social Media}, 2013.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent A very sophisticated approach to identify topics
  using a graph model with a decay rate. Specific to twitter as well.
  Unfortunately, they do not provide any summary examples! \end{quotation}

  summarization,'' in \emph{CS 224N Final Project Report}, 2013.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent They employ three different approaches to create
  summaries. Their paper is a nice overview and includes many features to
  consider. They discuss "stack decoder" formulations, clustering forumlations,
  and graph based formulations. \end{quotation}

A.~A. Submission, ``Argument mining in twitter: Recognizing premise tweets for
  claim hashtags,'' \emph{In prep}.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent Hashtags can be used to identify premises. They use
  different features (e.g. discourse indicators, informativeness, sentiment,
  tone) to identify whether tweets are premise tweets or not. These are then
  summarized. I could provide a better summarization perchance. \end{quotation}

  summarization using information extraction,'' in \emph{Proceedings of the
  Workshop on Language in Social Media (LASM 2013)}, June 2013, pp. 20--29.
 \begin{quotation}\noindent Authors claim that their system produces summaries
  that are more concise and news-worthy than SumBasic as evaluated by human
  judges. Their graph-based appraoch uses entities, event phrases, and
  connections between tweets. This builds off a previous work by \cite{lxywl06}
  on news articles. They provide a wonderful table, Table 1, of previous works
  I can use as reference. They begin by identifying events in tweets. They
  emphasize it is important to exploit the redundancy in tweets to find
  meaning. They map named entities and events together in a weighted graph;
  edge weight is the number of tweets the nodes co-occur in. They then use a
  modified version of PageRank. They use human evaluation. \end{quotation}

 \begin{quotation}\noindent Describes how one must modify summarization to
  account for tweets. What makes a good summary. \end{quotation}
