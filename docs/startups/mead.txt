INSTALLATION
Mead is a bit more difficult and troubling to get started. I found that most versions of it failed.
You can always try more from the website http://www.summarization.com/mead/.
I found that only version 3.10 actually ran.
To get it running you must first install perl.
Then there are many library dependencies.
For my computer, I installed all those found in /lib/mead-dependencies.
Follow the instructions defined by each one.
I do not have a proper installation order, trial and error will be the solution.
There also is a problem in the LexRank C++ code in this installation.
I have corrected it in my version, but if you redownload be sure to add
#include <pthread.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
to the beginning of prmain.h in $MEADDIR/bin/feature-scripts/lexrank/src
where in my case $MEADDIR is mead-3.10.
This is because thread-mutexes are utilized but the library is not imported for them.

Once all dependencies are built you must actually install mead again.
This updates the directory paths for your computer.
In the main mead directory just run perl Install.pl. If it exits with no errors you're set.
For further explanation of mead see /lib/mead-3.10/docs/meaddoc.pdf
